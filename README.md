# Open-Policy-Maker
This website was an hackathon submission for the Hacks&amp;Tools Hackathon during OER-Camp 2020. 
It provides legal support for teachers and schools looking to create, publish and use Open Educational Resources.

The tool allows schools to generate a suited and legally valid Open Policy and gives teachers guidance on how to license their
own teaching material.
